How do I approach designing software?
I think the steps to designing software always has to begin with an idea, from there you are able to create a general MVP or minimum viable product, give it a document that has the basic requirements for your design. Find out in ways how a use might interact with it, once you get this far you can start making the basic structure of the code, find out how you will connect mutliple pieces of code and how that reflects on your overall software requirements. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I think being able to think outside of the box, or in this case the openGL online tutorials that give you the same basic meshes. Realistically I should be able to look at all code packages the same as I do the basic meshses which came included with out packages, I should be able to take bits and pieces of different tools and create a whole new shape out of different shapes. However that might appear in my code in ways that can generate unique and creative uses of any available tool.
