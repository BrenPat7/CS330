From my view the steps to designing software always has to begin with an idea, from there you are able to create a general MVP or minimum viable product, give it a document that has the basic requirements for your design. Find out in ways how a use might interact with it, once you get this far you can start making the basic structure of the code, find out how you will connect mutliple pieces of code and how that reflects on your overall software requirements. 

Being able to think outside of the box, or in this case the openGL online tutorials that give you the same basic meshes. Realistically I should be able to look at all code packages the same as I do the basic meshses which came included with out packages, I should be able to take bits and pieces of different tools and create a whole new shape out of different shapes. However that might appear in my code in ways that can generate unique and creative uses of any available tool. 

I utitlized multiple methods throughout this class, one being the pseudo code on papaer to understand how I might connnect the dots of certain functions, another was building through testing. Through this prototyping way I was able to keep chipping away at the stone until I made something that seemingly resembled my intentions.

I think in general the ability to encounter bugs or design holes that need to be resolved, are always applicible metaphors for everyday work and home. I think in particular, my prototyping method is fun and agile to any final project, as with most cases when you start your project you are unaware of things that might effect your design or cause problems until you reach that part of the hiking trail. Ultimately being able to shift the path as I walk to find out what is the code which truly brings me to where I intended to be with the currently held knowledge.
